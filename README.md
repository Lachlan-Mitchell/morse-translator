###My Thought process

Initially I wanted to ensure I had all files/folders set up so it wouldnt be an issue later. The first file that I believe is most important to start working on is the test file. I set up all my conditions that I wanted my functions to complete, this will help me to stay inside project scope and lay down the foundations of the project.
